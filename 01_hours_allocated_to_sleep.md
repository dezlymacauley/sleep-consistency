# Sleep Consistency
_______________________________________________________________________________

### Rules

1. I will set aside 8 hours for sleep, every single day of the year.
This is a non-negotiable long-term lifestyle commitment I'm making. 

2. There will be no more overnight work. If I want to accelerate the progress,
of something, then I'll do it early in the morning when I'm fully rested.
overnight work is illogical because it means doing work when my brain is in
a sub-par state, and the hours gained from overnight work often come at the
cost of my health, and I have to recover those hours anyways.

- Day End => 09:00 PM
- Day Start => 05:00 AM
